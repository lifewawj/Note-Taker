# Note-Taker

## Description

Note Taker is a simple web application built with Express.js that allows users to create, save, and delete notes. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your notes efficiently.


## What I have learned

- Express.JS on how it works and how I can use it to connect the front end with the back end, building my very own web server. From the relationship of Client-side to Server-side.
